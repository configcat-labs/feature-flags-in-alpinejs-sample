# How to use feature flags with Alpine.js (WIP ðŸš§)

[Read the blog post here](https://configcat.com/blog/)

This is a fictional productivity app created to demonstrate feature flags in Alpine.js. The article walks you through the steps to deploy the **Set Daily Goal** button as the new feature. With [ConfigCat's feature flag service](https://configcat.com/), this new component can be deployed by remotely switching on its feature flag without having to edit and redeploy the app.
